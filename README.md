---------------------------------------------------------   WORK DIVISION   ------------------------------------------------------

Each member has put equal effort to make this project work. With our collective ideas we structed the HTML body and then assembled
it by styling it with CSS. The division of work among us is explained in detail below:


----------SAMI----------

 LOGIN PAGE: 
            Used a background image of 0.5 opacity of Air University and added a div element for "select student", which uses a
            hover and show property. when the user hover over the div, another div appears which has a list
            of students. User can click on any student to access the students information such as their Program info, Name,
            Roll no, Current and permanent address, Mids and Finals Dates, Attendance report, Marks report and study plan

HOMEPAGE:
            We used an identical header used to display whatever page you are on.
            Furthermore, a navbar is taken from bootstrap which was customized to have a dark background and added hover effects
            to make it user-friendly.
            Next up, we used nested div elements and unique class elements to make styling easier. There are 3 sections which 
            are basically tables, that have
                                            A header
                                            Main body (which has individual div elements for each info)
                                                - Having individual div elements


----------BISMA----------

ATTENDANCE REPORT: 
            The header for all pagess is same, now the Attendance Report shows a table which has columns such as Sr no, Subject 
            Name, Conducted Hours and Total hours, Credit hours and Attendance Percentage.
            Bisma used a div elements with similar classes to the ones in the homepage to match the CSS styles throughout
            the website. Some pages have individual CSS files attached (have links embedded in them) and some files have the same
            CSS files.
STUDY PLAN:
            With the same header and the navbar, study plan consists of 9 tables each showcasing lists of subjects. The table
            headers and contents have the same class names as the other table elements on every page. Each table has a heading
            aswell which have same classes to make styling easier.
SIGNOUT: 
            Signout button is just a link on the navbar which redirects the user to  the login page again.
            

----------HAFSA----------

MARKS REPORT: 
            Upon clicking or "marks report", which is unique to every student, the user sees an other button which upon
            hovering shows another div that has a list of subjects which upon clicking opens a page of the respective subject 
            page.
            That page has a main-header and a navbar with unique links, and for the content, it has a table with columns named
            Sr no, Examination Type, Obtained Marks and Total Marks. This table showcases attendace percentages of the 
            respective student.
            Since this project does not have a backend so Hafsa manually entered the data of each students into the respective 
            subjects. 

---------------------------------------------------------   FUNCTIONALITY   ------------------------------------------------------

each page has unique set of links for example:
Sami Zaman's homepage has the navbar which has links for marks report OF Sami Zaman, Attendance report OF Sami Zaman and lastly 
signout link which is not unique to anyone and only redirects the user to the login page once again.

---------------------------------------------------------   FINAL NOTE   ------------------------------------------------------

This Project was developed by us as our End-Of-Semester-Project to be submitted at the end of our FIRST semester. It only includes 
the frontend with HTML and CSS.
